    <h3>A Summary</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">.....why I decided to go into web development</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Inspired by my younger brother, a senior software engineer at Instacart, I left the healthcare industry to pursue software development. Speaking with him, the career seemed to have it all – critical thinking, problem solving, lifelong learning, and more. Seeing his growth, from creating an online tutoring service at age 16 to achieving his dream of working for a promising start-up, I wanted to learn what he knew, how computers work, and how to build things!</p>

    <p>Managing a pain office for the past 5 years, I did everything from counseling patients to transcription to assisting with surgical procedures. With each phone call presenting a problem from a patient, I definitely learned quick problem solving and communication skills. I had to stay organized while coordinating the doctor’s schedule, supply orders, prescription management, ordering various scans, dealing with insurance claims, and more. I am efficient, multi-tasking, and quick to anticipate people’s needs. All of the characteristics I needed for that job not only made me a more well-rounded person, but also left me desiring more of a challenge.</p>
